IntermediateRCourse


This course is aimed at bridging the gap between beginner's R i.e.
the use of basic R functions and routines to manipulate data and
the advanced use of R for data analytics [data science, writing
own packages and advanced statistical knowledge].

##Course assumptions: 
That you can install R, Rstudio and relevant packages.
You understand the basics of how R works and have a good working knowledge
of the base routines. You have a burning desire to use / advance your R skillset.
You would like to be able to reproduce your analytics and research and
understand the concept of workflows.

##Contents: 
We will follow the routines and working practices of Hadley Wykome.
We will present the background and rationale for the new ways of working with
R. We will introduce the framework of clean and tidy, ggplot2 and markdown
before trying some worked examples.

##Learning goals:
Understanding the basic concepts of the new syntax.
Application of new syntax to improve readability/reproducibility and efficiency.
Inspiration to use R for your own work!!
